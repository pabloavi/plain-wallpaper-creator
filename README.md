# plain-wallpaper-creator

This is a simple plain wallpaper creator: it creates the directory 'wallpaper' and places a full set of plain images (size 1920x1080) with the colors in file 'colors.txt'.

## How it works

The file 'plain-background.svg' is a .svg full of black pixels. All of them are replaced with the selected colors in the colors file (syntax is important) and placed in 'wallpapers/'.

## Dependencies

Following software is required:
- Inkscape.
